<h4><u>Description</u></h4>
<p>We have decided to create an e-commerce website that will cater for customers looking for baked goods. There will be an admin-end and a client-end interface. Whereas the admin-end interface of the website will allow developers and sellers to manage their products and keep the site up to date, the client-end interface will provide a user-friendly environment for customer to interact with the website.</p>
<p>Customers will be able to navigate through different categories of cakes and other baked goods. A search bar will assist customers to type in words or phrases of products they are looking for and will be taken to a results page with a list of products that relate to their search. Customers will be required to create an account that will allow them access to add products to and manage their carts, to place and track orders, and to add their personal information.</p>
